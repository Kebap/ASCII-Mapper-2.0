# ASCII-Mapper-2.0

This script is made in lua for using in Mudlet.
Since I made it for myself, to use it in the german MUD Morgengrauen, the directions and warnings are all in german.
But you can change it easily to use it in some english MUDs.

You can read the englisch readme here:

While the german readme can be found at:
